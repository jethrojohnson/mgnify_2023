# Introduction

The goal of this practical session is to evaluate using an OTU calling
approach as an alternative to denoising for the processing of 16S sequence data.
While a large number of tools are available for each step in a typical OTU calling
pipeline. This tutorial relies on [FLASh][flash-website] for amplicon assembly, and
[USEARCH][usearch-homepage] for OTU calling.

## Session One
----------------------------------
# 1. Using a text editor to document your actions (Optional)<a name="header1"></a>

During this session you may wish to keep a record of the commands used to analyse your 16S data. 
One way to do this is to write each command to a file. From the command line, this can be 
acheived using a [text editor][texteditor-wikipedia]. There are many to choose from, but this 
session will use Nano.

{% highlight bash %}
# Create a working directory for this session
mkdir ~/amplicon_otu
cd ~/amplicon_otu
pwd

# Open a new file
nano 16s_pipeline.sh
{% endhighlight %}
 
Opening a new text file you should see something similar to this: 

![Nano]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/NanoExample.png)
 
> Try writing some text to the document 16s_pipeline.sh<br>
> Try saving the document, closing it, and re-opening it.

Because the saved document is a shell script, it is also possible to run the entire 
script from the command line.

{% highlight bash %}
# Make the file 16s_pipeline.sh executable from the command line.
chmod u+x 16s_pipeline.sh

# run the code in 16s_pipeline.sh
./16s_pipeline.sh
{% endhighlight %}


For more information on using nano, see the Nano [online documentation][nano-homepage]. 
<br>
<br>

----------------------------------
# 2. Fetching 16S sequence data<a name="header2"></a>

To begin, it's necessary to fetch the 16S sequence data that will be used for this
tutorial.

{% highlight bash %}
# Create a subdirectory for storing fastq files
cd ~/amplicon_otu
mkdir fastqs
cd fastqs
cp  ~/.thursday_pm/data/input_fastq/*fastq.*.gz .
ls                                        
{% endhighlight %}
 
These data were generated by sequencing the V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene
using 2x300 base pair paired-end sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq. There should be two files per sample,
with the files *.fastq.1.gz and *.fastq.2.gz containing the first and second reads in each 
pair, respectively. Have a look at the first four lines in one of the fastqs.

{% highlight bash %}

zcat sample1_trimmed.fastq.1.gz | head -4

@M03204:217:000000000-B8W8J:1:2108:24791:7353

{% endhighlight %}

NB. Sequences in these files have been trimmed to remove adapters, but are otherwise untouched.

<br>
<br>
<br>

----------------------------------
# 3. Combining paired-end reads into contiguous sequences<a name="header3"></a> 

In order to generate a single, contiguous sequence spanning the target region of the 16S gene, it's
necessary the paired reads in each fastq file. To do this we will use a tool called FLASh. It's
first necessary to ensure this tool is accessible from the command line.

{% highlight bash %}
export PATH=~/.thursday_pm/bin/:$PATH
which flash
{% endhighlight %}

We can then start by combining fastq files containing forward and reverse reads for a single sample.

{% highlight bash %}
# Check you've returned to the run directory for this session
cd ~/amplicon_otu
pwd

# Run FLASh for a single sample
flash ./fastqs/sample1_trimmed.fastq.1.gz ./fastqs/sample1_trimmed.fastq.2.gz

# The files created by FLASh should be in the current directory
ls
{% endhighlight %}

> Have a look at the files created by FLASh, in particular the file out.extendedFrags.fastq<br>
> Are all sequences the same length?
> How many sequences were successfully assembled and how many failed to assemble? 

For information on options for running FLASh and the files it creates visit the
[website][flash-website], or access the help documentation on the command line.

{% highlight bash %}
flash --help
{% endhighlight %}

<br>

#### 3.b. Running FLASh using a for loop<a name="header3b"></a>

While it's possible to run FLASh individually for each sample, for convenience we will use a for loop
to iteratively combine fastqs for all the samples in the fastq directory.

{% highlight bash %}
# make a directory in which to store the combined fastq files
mkdir fastqs_combined

ls 
ls fastqs_combined

# Run FLASh for all samples in the working directory
for FASTQ1 in fastqs/*.fastq.1.gz
do
  # capture the file prefix, which corresponds to the sample name
  SAMPLEID="$(basename ${FASTQ1%.fastq.1.gz})"
  # assign the second fastq file to the variable FASTQ2
  FASTQ2="fastqs/${SAMPLEID}.fastq.2.gz"
  # run FLASh 
  flash $FASTQ1 $FASTQ2 --output-prefix=$SAMPLEID --output-directory=fastqs_combined
done

ls fastqs_combined
{% endhighlight %}

> If you're using your text editor, copy the for loop into your pipeline script. <br>
> Remember to annotate your code so that you can return to it later.

<br>

#### 3.c. Converting fastq files to fasta format

From here on, it's necessary to work with fasta files, rather than fastq.
It's possible to convert our data from fastq to fasta format using the 
[FASTX-toolkit][fastx-homepage].

{% highlight bash %}
# Run fastq_to_fasta for the combined fastq files created by FLASh
for FASTQ in fastqs_combined/*.extendedFrags.fastq
do
  # capture the file prefix, which corresponds to the sample name
  SAMPLEID="${FASTQ%.extendedFrags.fastq}"
  printf 'Processing %s\n' $FASTQ
  # run fastq_to_fasta
  fastq_to_fasta -Q33 -i $FASTQ -o $SAMPLEID.fasta
done

# The fasta files should now be in the same directory as the combined fastqs
ls fastqs_combined
{% endhighlight %}

<br>

----------------------------------
# 4. Generating a unique set of 16S gene sequences<a name="header4"></a>

Having successfully processed our sequence data, the goals now are to:
1. Identify distinct biological taxa
2. Quantify the relative abundance of each distinct taxon

These goals are predicated on the assumption that the extent to which two distinct bacterial
taxa are related correlates with the similarity of their 16S rRNA gene sequences. Different
taxa can therefore be identified by resolving unique 16S gene sequences and counting their 
abundance. 

As we're using USEARCH for this purpose, the first step is to pool 16S gene sequences from
different samples into one file. In order to keep track of which sequence originated from which 
sample, it is also necessary to add the sample name to samplesthe header line for each fasta sequence. 
For simplicity, this step will be carried out using a custom script. 

{% highlight bash %}
# The location of the script for combining fasta files
which samples2fasta

# Combine samples into a single file located in the run directory
samples2fasta fastqs_combined all_samples.fasta
{% endhighlight %}

The second step is to create a file containing a single copy of each unique sequence in the
dataset, as each unique sequence potentially represents a uniqlue bacterial taxon. When the
`-sizeout` argument is provided USEARCH keeps a record of the number of times each unique
sequence appears in the data set. 

{% highlight bash %}
# How many sequences are in the combined fasta file?
cat all_samples.fasta | grep ">" | wc -l

# Fetch the latest version of USEARCH
rm ~/.thursday_pm/bin/usearch
ln -s ~/.thursday_pm/bin/src/usearch11.0.667_i86linux32 ~/.thursday_pm/bin/usearch
which usearch

# Run USEARCH to generate a file of unique sequences
usearch -fastx_uniques all_samples.fasta -fastaout all_unique_seqs.fasta -sizeout
{% endhighlight %}

> Have a look at the first four lines of `all_unique_seqs.fasta` to see where sizeout is recorded.<br>

<br>

Sequence variation may represent distinct bacterial taxa, but it may also be caused by errors
during sequencing. If a bacterial taxon is present at a detectable abundance in these samples, then
its 16S gene sequence is likely to be represented multiple times in the data set. By contrast,
sequencing error is assumed to be (more-or-less) random, meaning that errors due to sequencing have
only a small likelihood of occurring more than once. For this reason it is common practice to 
discard unique sequences that occur one, or a few times. The next step is to sort unique sequences
based on their frequency of occurrence, and to discard those that occur only once. 

{% highlight bash %}
# Sort unique sequences based on the number of times they occur, discarding singletons
usearch -sortbysize all_unique_seqs.fasta -fastaout all_unique_seqs_sorted.fasta -minsize 2
{% endhighlight %}

> How many unique sequences remain after removing singletons? <br>
> How many unique sequences remain if you discard sequences occurring less than five times?

<br>
<br>


----------------------------------
# 5. Clustering unique sequences into operational taxonomic units<a name="header5"></a>

The goal of this practical  is to identify and quantify distinct bacterial taxa.
Assuming that a certain amount of 16S gene sequence variation exists within species (different
bacterial strains?) we will generate operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on the assumption 
that two sequences which are more than 97% similar belong to the same species. There is a
more nuanced discussion of exactly what 97% OTUs mean on the USEARCH [website][usearch-definingotus].

![Uparse]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/uparseotu_algo.jpeg)


The UPARSE-OTU algorithm, implemented in USEARCH, can be used to generate OTUs based on this 97%
similarity threshold. It selects a single representative sequence for each generated OTU.

{% highlight bash %}
# Cluster OTUs using a 97% similarity threshold
usearch -cluster_otus all_unique_seqs_sorted.fasta -otus otus.fasta
{% endhighlight %}

> How many OTUs have been generated? <br>
> How many chimeras were detected? <br>


Note that [chimeras][usearch-chimera] can be a significant problem in amplicon-based sequence analysis.
There are dedicated tools for chimera detection and removal (e.g. [ChimeraSlayer][chimeraslayer-home]);
however the UPARSE-OTU algorithm implicitly filters chimeras.

 
<br>
<br>

----------------------------------
# 6. Creating a table of OTU abundance<a name="header6"></a>

Having generated a set of sequences representing distinct bacterial taxa (OTUs). The next step is to
quantify OTU abundance. This can be acheived by counting the number of sequences in each sample that
match each OTU. For a sequence to "match" an OTU it must be more than 97% similar to the 
representative sequence for that OTU.

The first step is to relabel each of our OTUs with a unique identifier. We will do this using a 
python script fasta_number.py

{% highlight bash %}
# fetch the fasta_number.py python script to the current working directory
ln -s ~/.thursday_pm/bin/drive5_py/fasta_number.py .

# call python script to rename the OTUs in the format OTU_*
python fasta_number.py otus.fasta OTU_ > otus_renamed.fasta
{% endhighlight %}


The next step is to use the pooled fasta file (`all_samples.fasta`) generated in
[Section 4](#header4) to map the sequences originating from each sample file back their closest
matching OTUs. Sample sequences that do not match any OTU sequenced at >97% similarity are assumed
to be sequencing errors and are discarded.

{% highlight bash %}
# Use USEARCH otutab command to map original sequences back to OTUs
usearch -otutab all_samples.fasta -otus otus_renamed.fasta -otutabout otu_matrix.tsv -mapout map.txt
{% endhighlight %}

The resulting file `otu_matrix.tsv` is a count matrix in which columns are samples, rows are OTUs
and each cell represents the number of sequences assigned to each OTU in each sample. 

<br>
<br>

----------------------------------
# 7. Assigning taxonomy to OTU sequences<a name="header7"></a>

Having generated a matrix of OTU abundance in different samples it's necessary to match OTU
sequences against a reference database in order to infer their taxonmy. One simple way to
do this would be to copy each sequence into  NCBI's [BLAST][ncbi-ntblast] tool, which can be
used to match sequences to the RefSeq 16S ribosomal RNA sequences database. (See the accompanying
[ASV tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-10-12-Analysing-16S-data-with-ASVs %}) for an
example of this.)

An alternative method for classifying 16S gene sequences is to use the Ribosomal Database Project
(RDP) classifier tool, which compares sequences to the [RDP reference database][rdp-database].
The RDP classifier can be run from the command line without the need to download the entire
reference database. 

{% highlight bash %}
# Run the RDP classifer. As this tool is written in java, it's necessary to first run
# java then pass the location of the installed classifier
java -Xmx1g -jar ~/.thursday_pm/bin/rdp_classifier_2.14/dist/classifier.jar classify \
  -f filterbyconf \
  -c 0.8 \
  -o otu_taxonomy_rdp_0.8.tsv \
  -h otu_taxonomy.hierachy \
  otus_renamed.fasta
{% endhighlight %}

> Have a look at the two files (`otu_taxonomy_rdp_0.8.tsv` and `otu_taxonomy.hierachy`) produced by
> the RDP classifier.

The RDP classifier produces two files the first `otu_taxonomy_rdp_0.8.tsv` contains a taxonomic
classification from each OTU from Kingdom to Genus level. The second `otu_taxonomy.hierachy`
contains similar information in a commonly used hierachical format. Each taxonomic level encountered
in our dataset is listed in this file, with the final column showing the number of times it is 
encountered. 

For further information on the options available when running the RDP classifer have a look at the
help pages.

{% highlight bash %}
# Running RDP without input arguments will cause it to print its help pages.
java -Xmx1g -jar ~/.thursday_pm/bin/rdp_classifier_2.14/dist/classifier.jar 
java -Xmx1g -jar ~/.thursday_pm/bin/rdp_classifier_2.14/dist/classifier.jar classify
{% endhighlight %}

> What does the command `-c 0.8` mean?
 
<br>
<br>

----------------------------------
# 8. Amalgamating code into a pipeline script<a name="header8"></a>

Finally, having worked out how to  run each of the steps necssary to generate an OTU count table,
it should now be possible to take the code for each step and add it to the script
`16s_pipeline.sh`.

This effectively creates a simple computational pipeline. As the resulting script does not contain
any hardcoded sample names, it should be possible to run it on other datasets.

<br>
<br>

----------------------------------
## Conclusions<a name="header9"></a>

This session provides an overview of the fundamental steps taken to process 16S gene
sequence data from raw reads into operational taxonomic units that can be used for downstream
analysis.

Consider heading to the [second tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2023-10-12-Analysing-16S-data-with-ASVs %}) in this session for a comparison of this approach versus a 'denoising' approach that generates amplicons sequence variants (ASVs).
